# Using Tessel's Wifi

Tessel 2 has robust Wifi built into the board. Let's get connected!

### Connect

To connect to a new network, enter in your command line (without brackets)

`t2 wifi -n <network-name> -p <password>`  

_Note: Wifi radio on Tessel can only connect to 2.4GHz networks. As of yet, you cannot connect over a 5GHz network.<br>
_Note: if you have spaces in your network name, or password, add quotes around the network name and/or password_
`t2 wifi -n "<network name with spaces>" -p "<password with spaces>"`

The password flag is optional. Tessel 2 will save network credentials and attempt to reconnect automatically on startup.

Wifi connectivity is indicated by the on-board amber Wifi LED, which will blink with every packet it receives.

### Authorize

On Tessel 2, you can run and push your code over Wifi, not just USB. Let's get that set up. Run:

`t2 provision`

This authorizes your computer to push code to the connected Tessel 2.

Now, run:

`t2 list`

Assuming your computer is connected to the same network as your Tessel 2, you should see it listed by name, as a "LAN" connection, something like:

{% highlight sh %}
INFO Searching for nearby Tessels...
	Bulbasaur	LAN
	Bulbasaur	USB
{% endhighlight %}

You might see (as in the example) that your Tessel is connected via both USB and LAN. The connection will automatically prefer LAN, since it's faster, but you can control this by adding `--lan` or `--usb` to any command.

### Update

Great! now that we're connected and authorized, let's check for updates. Run:

`t2 update`

This command will check for a new version of the Tessel 2 firmware. If there is an update available, it will be downloaded and installed.
