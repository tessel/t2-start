These are instructions for Tessel 2. Start [here for Tessel 1](//tessel.io/t1-start).

*New to the command line? [Take a step back and learn the basics.](cmd.html)*

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is a prerequisite for installing the Tessel command line. You can install it from the [official website](http://nodejs.org/), or if you have [brew](http://brew.sh/) installed: `brew install node`

Once Node.js is installed, run this installation script from your terminal:

<big>`npm install -g t2-cli`</big>

*Note: If you get the common npm EACCES error, correct it by [fixing npm permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions) and then running `npm install -g t2-cli` again.*

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) v4.x or newer is a prerequisite for installing the Tessel command line. You can install it from the [official website](http://nodejs.org) or following [these instructions from Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions):

`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo -E bash -`

`sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`

*Note: Piping a script into a shell with root access can be a security issue. Feel free to [read the script contents](https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x) before executing the commands.*

Once Node is installed, install USB dependencies:

`apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev`

Then, install the Tessel 2 command line interface:

`npm install -g t2-cli`

*Note: If you get the common npm EACCES error, correct it by [fixing npm permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions) and then running `npm install -g t2-cli` again. Using sudo is not recommended. Here is a handy [shell script](https://github.com/glenpike/npm-g_nosudo#npm-g_nosudo) to fix permissions issues.*

Finally, you will need to install Tessel USB rules:

`sudo t2 install-drivers`

*Note: This is a one-time operation that uses `sudo` and you should not use it for any other Tessel commands.*

</div>

<div id="tab-windows" class="content">

On Windows, Tessel drivers will install automatically when you plug in.

On Windows 7, you may receive the notification "Device driver software was not successfully installed". If you do, click on the notification, click the "Change settings..." button, and then select "Install driver software from Windows Update if it is not found on my computer." Save changes and re-try.

On Windows, if the drivers are still not installing properly, it may be necessary to install [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie/) in order to install generic USB drivers (WinUSB).  Download the application, open it and choose "Install WCID Driver."

Next, install [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org). You need this to interact with Tessel from the command line.

After installing the Tessel drivers and Node.js, run this in cmd.exe:

<big>`npm install -g t2-cli`</big>

### Find your Tessel

Plug in your Tessel over USB (use Tessel's microUSB port, between the USB ports and the module ports).

*It takes ~30s to finish booting up (track the issue [here](https://github.com/tessel/t2-firmware/issues/117)); lights will flash during this process.*

Run:

`t2 list`

<div class="large-12 columns">

You should be able to see your Tessel (and any other Tessels connected to the same network as your computer):

{% highlight sh %}
INFO Searching for nearby Tessels...
  USB Tessel-AF768F095
{% endhighlight %}

Yay, you found it! At this point, your Tessel is operational and in communication with your computer.

<hr>

**Bonus:** give your Tessel a name, like "Frank" or "Bulbasaur":

`t2 rename <name>`

If you run `t2 list` again, you'll see your Tessel has changed its name:

{% highlight sh %}
INFO Searching for nearby Tessels...
  USB Bulbasaur
{% endhighlight %}
