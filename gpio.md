Tessel's two module ports are not just for modules– they can also be used as flexible, simply [addressable GPIO](//tessel.io/docs/hardwareAPI) (general purpose input/output) pins.

What does that mean? It means you're not limited to Tessel's ten-pin modules. In theory, you can connect nearly any electronic device or sensor to Tessel!

There is now a Tessel 2-based kit called the [Johnny-Five Inventor's Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13847?_ga=1.139920435.1460354922.1460705643) which gets you started with electronic components, complete with its own thorough [Experiment Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/experiment-guide-for-the-johnny-five-inventors-kit/introduction-to-the-johnny-five-inventors-kit).

### Community modules

For an experience nearly as easy as Tessel's ten-pin module experience, take a look at the [Community Modules](https://tessel.io/modules#third-party).

These are hardware components for which members of the community have created npm libraries, documentation, and wiring information.

For example:

<iframe frameborder='0' height='270' scrolling='no' src='https://www.hackster.io/adkron/backpack-ht16k33/embed?use_route=project' width='360'></iframe>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="large-12 columns">
<br/>
To see more community-created modules (or to add one you've made!) go to [tessel.io/modules](https://tessel.io/modules#third-party).

_Note: we're still building out Tessel 2's firmware, so you might hit some bugs trying to use community modules. If you do, please report them! We're collecting status reports on community modules [here](https://github.com/tessel/hardware-modules/issues/5)._

### Making your own Modules

If no one has made the module you want yet, you can be the first! There are a lot of cool components on [SparkFun](//sparkfun.com) and [Adafruit](//adafruit.com) that are fairly easy to connect to Tessel.

In case you've never built anything with hardware before, we've put up an introduction at [tessel.io/diy](//tessel.io/diy) that should get you up and running.

Share what you've made, and if you need help, [just ask](https://forums.tessel.io/c/community-modules). Happy inventing!
